- Probably want to add IsArchived to Skill so we can archive skills but they can still be seen in snapshots

- Dbcontext.savechanges in the repository base classes is causing admins to save unencrypted - need to actually encrypt and decrypt the values rather than on save/load only?
- Or explicitly have a decrypted name property which just gets and decrypts, idk

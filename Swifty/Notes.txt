- Admin Service should also inherit from an IAdminService with outline of what it does - anything using this service via DI can then be coded to the contract rather than implementation
- Should be able to remove EntityBase class - just make base level repo inherit from class, IEntityBase rather than EntityBase, follow it up the chain then
- Make skill Level and skill area archiveable (follow same pattern)
- Make the setup page for skills
- Make a setup link in the homepage
- Design the nav bar with everything we want in there including the setup links above

Current ToDo:
----------------------

- Finish off the setup page for skills so all relevant pages include skill level and skill area (need to add BuildSelectListAsync and probably service implementation to get names etc)

- Make a setup link in the homepage
- Design the nav bar with everything we want in there including the setup links above

- Make setup pages for Admins
	- Bear in mind this needs to decrypt/encrypt data too

- Before making anything further past setup, to do with skillsnapshots, try and create the skillsnapshot entity properly so we don't need the skillsnapshotskilllink entity.
- If to no avail, maybe we at least rename this as it will be used everywhere, shorter is nicer?
- Plan out architecture of skill marking/skill loading/skill snapshots before diving in


----------------------
Future notes/thoughts:
----------------------

- SkillService should have GetAllBySkillAreaAndSkillLevel(SkillArea area, int SkillLevel), GetAllBySkillArea(SkillArea area), GetAllBySkillLevel(int SkillLevel)
- When marking a new snapshot, admins should have ability to load in a previous snapshot (so they can go from there). Would need to clone the existing one, not actually load it by reference.
- Skill Index screen should really be like the card output with option to edit, rather than a list of ALL of them. Or at least have tabs by skill level. That'll probably call service.


----------------------

When everything is done:

----------------------

- Put it up as a site somewhere and link to local DB (or copy DB) so it can be accessed via a URL instead of localhost/debugging

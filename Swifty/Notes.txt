Current ToDo:
----------------------


- Make the setup page for skills
- Add 'Archived' flag to details/edit pages for skill, skill level, skill area

- Make a setup link in the homepage
- Design the nav bar with everything we want in there including the setup links above

- Make setup pages for Admins
	- Bear in mind this needs to decrypt/encrypt data too


----------------------
Future notes/thoughts:
----------------------

- When marking a new snapshot, admins should have ability to load in a previous snapshot (so they can go from there). Would need to clone the existing one, not actually load it by reference.

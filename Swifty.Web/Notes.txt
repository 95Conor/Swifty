Current ToDo:
----------------------

Remaining Functionality ToDo:


- Ability for an admin to load a preexisting skillsnapshot into a template for a new snapshot (create a button on the skillsnapshot View page if the user is an admin which posts to new page. New page just needs a handler which accepts an id of a skillsnapshot to load it as template.)

- Ability to create/edit/delete/see all users (even though they are automatically created on login it will be useful for admins when making new snapshots for first time if user hasn't seen site).

- Add a little 'key' on relevant pages outlining what the colours mean. Make these configurable.

- Can we save reviewer notes as HTML instead? Use a rich text editor to save/load/show.

- Make sure skill snapshots etc account for archived skills (and show a certain colour if it is)

- Is there still an issue where for some reason you are no authorised to see the first skill snapshot?

- Ability to have a 'Journal' screen whereby users can literally just save loads of notes and examples?
	- If have the time, could even allow them to associate a skill ID with a note, so they have all these notes and examples for next review

Styling/Front-End:


- UI styling upgrade for all screens with common theme. Try some animations and things. Maybe a background in layout for all pages - something like slow falling snow but cooler? Idk.
	- 'Process' in skill snapshot screen (workflow)
	- Animated/shadings on skill boards and hover etc. Nicer background colours, use some opacity? Less harsh colours?
		- For skillSnapshot admin page - make a workflow process with nav bar, make checkboxes not look like checkboxes and fill row, unselect others when selected, skill card backgrounds should change colour, etc


Extra:

- Improve error handling across the board and utilise the errors available in the BaseViewModel (and output these in the shared Layout?)
	- Also log errors?

- Go through all screens and code behind, tidy up code and improve. Can introduce any new design patterns to solve things? Less repetition of things.

Future notes/thoughts:
----------------------


----------------------
When everything is done:
----------------------

- Search for 'ToDo' and clean up all ToDo's where necessary
- Put it up as a site somewhere and link to local DB (or copy DB) so it can be accessed via a URL instead of localhost/debugging

----------------------
Tech Debt for later improvement:
----------------------

- The view models for holding and processing the skill board data is way too nested in collections, this should be simplified
- Should be using more mapping when view models are assigned, probably introduce a view model builder pattern so we can map extra stuff outside of Automapper

Current ToDo:
----------------------

- Create SkillBoard admin page (Same as normal one, but, links to go directly to the skill setup, and ability to (+) new skills at the bottom (defaults area and level when you go to skill setup))
	- These links will probably want to redirect back to the admin board after rather than the skill setup index screen (Pass soomething in query parameter maybe).

- Make setup pages for Admins
	- Bear in mind this needs to decrypt/encrypt data too

- Update SkillSnapshot entity so it includes admin name (email) who marked it, and a string Notes, plus anything else.

- Update SkillSnapshot repository/service architecture so it handles the SkillSetSkillLink in a easier way to utilise
	- SkillSetService and SkillService should have all the logic/functions whereby SkilLSetSkillLink objects are dealt with
		- Could we just have an EXTENSION on the SkillSet repository which LOADS all of the SkillSetSkillLink and then loads the Skills entities and returns a list of Skills??
			- Attempted the achieve the above in PersistSkillCollection function in SkillSetRepository - should just be able to call SkillSet.Set when using and it will be populated 

- Create SkillSnapshot admin page - ability to create a skill snapshot for users

- Create SkillSnapshot landing page - ability to see all listed skill snapshots for that specific user based on user priniciap email claim (add function to UserService to GetUserByEmailClaim)

- Create SkillSnapshot overview page - where the User will see the skill snapshot overview (skills with colours, notes, date and admin who marked it).

- Potentially add a way for Admins to see all Users SkillSnapshots?

- UI styling upgrade for the Skill Boards

- Improve error handling across the board and utilise the errors available in the BaseViewModel (and output these in the shared Layout?)


----------------------
Future notes/thoughts:
----------------------

- SkillService should have GetAllBySkillAreaAndSkillLevel(SkillArea area, int SkillLevel), GetAllBySkillArea(SkillArea area), GetAllBySkillLevel(int SkillLevel)
- When marking a new snapshot, admins should have ability to load in a previous snapshot (so they can go from there). Would need to clone the existing one, not actually load it by reference.
- Skill Index screen should really be like the card output with option to edit, rather than a list of ALL of them. Or at least have tabs by skill level. That'll probably call service.
- SkillSnapshot should maybe also have the Admin email saved against it so that it can be displayed, so a user knows who gave them that skillsnapshot, years down the line
- SkillSnapshot may also have a notes string against it whereby the marker can add loads of notes and will then be displayed when the user sees the skillsnapshot? e.g. improve on this, do this, that.
- When new SkillSnapshot is being made by admin, first it should let them select user, then post user ID - when page reloads it see's user ID query string so loads entire page for marking then

----------------------
When everything is done:
----------------------

- Do some front-end learning and make the site MUCH snazzier and user friendly (boards and snapshots and homepage). 
- Put it up as a site somewhere and link to local DB (or copy DB) so it can be accessed via a URL instead of localhost/debugging

Current ToDo:
----------------------

- Create SkillSnapshot admin page - ability to create a skill snapshot for users
	- TODO:
	- Add error/success messages to page on post-back
	- Make .EditFor for ReviewerNotes a bit nicer to use
	- Make a brief 'flow' so we can choose user, then board review, then notes and submit (javascript show/hide)
	- Fix green/red/amber checkbox appearance so it's nice (have a think, maybe not a checkbox at all but something nicer)
	- Make skill cards change colour when checkbox is selected and only allow one selection a ta time
	- Overall improvement to page styling (flow bar at the top for process, the skill board (try them with white text and gray/black background? Site background darker?))

- Create SkillSnapshot landing page - ability to see all listed skill snapshots for that specific user based on user priniciap email claim (add function to UserService to GetUserByEmailClaim)

- Create SkillSnapshot overview page - where the User will see the skill snapshot overview (skills with colours, notes, date and admin who marked it).

- Potentially add a way for Admins to see all Users SkillSnapshots (and then load them into a new skillsnapshot as a starting point?)



- UI styling upgrade for the Skill Boards and Skill Snapshots etc, general pages to be used should look nicer

- Improve error handling across the board and utilise the errors available in the BaseViewModel (and output these in the shared Layout?)
	- Also log errors?


----------------------
Future notes/thoughts:
----------------------

- SkillService should have GetAllBySkillAreaAndSkillLevel(SkillArea area, int SkillLevel), GetAllBySkillArea(SkillArea area), GetAllBySkillLevel(int SkillLevel)
- When marking a new snapshot, admins should have ability to load in a previous snapshot (so they can go from there). Would need to clone the existing one, not actually load it by reference.
- Skill Index screen should really be like the card output with option to edit, rather than a list of ALL of them. Or at least have tabs by skill level. That'll probably call service.
- SkillSnapshot should maybe also have the Admin email saved against it so that it can be displayed, so a user knows who gave them that skillsnapshot, years down the line
- SkillSnapshot may also have a notes string against it whereby the marker can add loads of notes and will then be displayed when the user sees the skillsnapshot? e.g. improve on this, do this, that.
- When new SkillSnapshot is being made by admin, first it should let them select user, then post user ID - when page reloads it see's user ID query string so loads entire page for marking then
- Add a little key on the skill snapshot screen to show what green/red/amber mean (descriptions) - can make these customisable by a screen or a config value (or both)
- Probably need a way to delete users (make a setup page like admin?) for when people leave etc in future. Might also be useful to be able to add them.

----------------------
When everything is done:
----------------------

- Search for 'ToDo' and clean up all ToDo's where necessary
- Do some front-end learning and make the site MUCH snazzier and user friendly (boards and snapshots and homepage). 
- Put it up as a site somewhere and link to local DB (or copy DB) so it can be accessed via a URL instead of localhost/debugging

----------------------
Tech Debt for later improvement:
----------------------

- The view models for holding and processing the skill board data is way too nested in collections, this should be simplified
- Front-end is really shit and needs improvement once functionality is there - use blazor if possible
- New SkillShot admin screen is really bad, ideally the 'select user', 'skill board', and 'notes/submit' should be in a flow where you can go back and fourth on the same page
